LSPG stands for the Greek Large-Scale Pilot.

The files in the lspg folder are used for missions with the retrofitted tractor in Greece.
The files in the lspgc folder are used for missions with the Carob robot in Greece.

Please note that the geojson files in the lspgc folder are identical to those in the lspg folder, as both folders describe the same environment. The difference lies in the mobile platform used.
